                    CleanReed is designed to be a more organized and sleek way
                    of browsing select subreddit pages. The future goal of this
                    project is to automatically take posts from any subreddit
                    you choose from and displaying everything neatly in rows,
                    while also allowing users to also securely link their
                    account credentials with the app
                </h2>
            </div>
        )
